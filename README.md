# Autonomous-Charging-Dock

Brief introduction of the project here

# Problem-Statement

Given a Mobile ALOHA robot (https://www.trossenrobotics.com/robotic-arms), which is equipped with (list sensors), our task is to navigate the robot to a charging dock without any mapping of the area and from any location. Hopefully, we will reach this goal with at least 80% accuracy.

# Use-Cases

Ideally, having this autonomous charging dock implemented would allow us to run experiments and data collection overnight, and after completion it would automatically return to the charging port and be fully charged for another day of testing.
